ðŸ“Œ **Single Responsibility** _(a class (module) should have one, and only one, reason to change, i.e. every class should have only one responsibility)_:
- [wrong way](srp/bad/srp.go)
- [right way](srp/good/srp.go)

ðŸ“Œ **Open-Closed** _(software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification)_:
- [wrong way](ocp/bad/ocp.go)
- [right way](ocp/good/ocp.go)

ðŸ“Œ **Liskov Substitution** _(functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it)_:
- [wrong way](lsp/bad/lsp.go)
- [right way](lsp/good/lsp.go)
